      The <strong>seven deadly sins</strong>, also known as the <strong>capital vices</strong> or <strong>cardinal sins</strong>,
      is a grouping and classification of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice">vices</a> within Christian teachings.
      Behaviours or habits are classified under this category if they directly give birth to other immoralities. According to the
      standard list, they are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride">pride</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greed">
      greed</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lust">lust</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envy">envy</a>,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluttony">gluttony</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrath">wrath</a>
      and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloth_(deadly_sin)">sloth</a>, which are also contrary to the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_virtues">seven virtues</a>. These
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_views_on_sin">sins</a> are often thought to be abuses or excessive
      versions of one's natural faculties or passions (for example, gluttony abuses one's desire to eat).
    </p>
    <p>
      This classification originated with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Fathers">desert fathers</a>,
      especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evagrius_Ponticus">Evagrius Ponticus</a>, who identified seven
      or eight evil thoughts or spirits that one needed to overcome. Evagrius' pupil
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cassian">John Cassian</a>, with his book <em>The Institutes</em>, brought the
      classification to Europe, where it became fundamental to Catholic confessional practices as evident in penitential manuals,
      sermons like "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Parson%27s_Tale">The Parson's Tale</a>" from Chaucer's
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canterbury_Tales"><em>Canterbury Tales</em></a>, and artworks like Dante's
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purgatorio"><em>Purgatory</em></a> (where the penitents of Mount Purgatory are depicted
      as being grouped and penanced according to the worst capital sin they committed). The Catholic Church used the concept of the
      deadly sins in order to help people curb their inclination towards evil before dire consequences and misdeeds could occur; the
      leader-teachers especially focused on pride (which is thought to be the sin that severs the soul from Grace, and the one that
      is representative and the very essence of all evil) and greed, both of which are seen as inherently sinful and as underlying
      all other sins to be prevented. To inspire people to focus on the seven deadly sins, the vices are discussed in treatises and
      depicted in paintings and sculpture decorations on Catholic churches as well as older textbooks.

        <h3>Greco-Roman antecedents</h3>
        <p>
          While the seven deadly sins as we know them did not originate with the Greeks or Romans, there were ancient precedents
          for them. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle">Aristotle's</a>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomachean_Ethics"><em>Nicomachean Ethics</em></a> lists several positive, healthy
          human qualities, excellences, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue">virtues</a>. Aristotle argues that for
          each positive quality there are two negative vices that are found on each extreme of the virtue. Courage,for example, is
          the human excellence or virtue in facing fear and risk. Excessive courage makes one rash, while a deficiency of
          courage makes one cowardly. This principle of virtue found in the middle or "mean" between excess and deficiency is
          Aristotle's notion of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_mean_(philosophy)">golden mean</a>.
          Aristotle lists virtues like courage, temperance or self-control, generosity, "greatness of soul," proper response to
          anger, friendliness, and wit or charm.
        </p>
        <p>
          Roman writers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace">Horace</a> extolled the value of virtue while listing
          and warning against vices. His first epistles says that "to flee vice is the beginning of virtue, and to have got rid of
          folly is the beginning of wisdom."

        <h3>Origin of the currently recognized Seven Deadly Sins</h3>
        <p>
          The modern concept of the seven deadly sins is linked to the works of the fourth-century
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk">monk</a>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evagrius_Ponticus">Evagrius Ponticus</a>, who listed eight evil thoughts in
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language">Greek</a> as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Γαστριμαργία (<em>gastrimargia</em>) gluttony

          <li>
            Ὑπερηφανία (<em>hyperēphania</em>) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride">pride</a> – sometimes rendered
            as self-overestimation
          </li>
          <li>
            Λύπη (<em>lypē</em>) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadness">sadness</a> – in the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philokalia"><em>Philokalia</em></a>, this term is rendered as envy, sadness
            at another's good fortune
          </li>
          <li>
            Ὀργή (<em>orgē</em>) wrath
          </li>
          <li>
            Κενοδοξία (<em>kenodoxia</em>) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boasting">boasting</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Ἀκηδία (<em>akēdia</em>) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acedia">acedia</a> – in the Philokalia, this term
            is rendered as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)">dejection</a>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          They were translated into the Latin of Western Christianity (largely due to the writings of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cassian">John Cassian</a>), thus becoming part of the Western tradition's
          spiritual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietas_(virtue)">pietas</a> (or
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_devotions">Catholic devotions</a>), as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <em>Gula</em> (gluttony)
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Luxuria/Fornicatio</em> (lust, fornication)
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Avaritia</em> (avarice/greed)
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Superbia</em> (pride, hubris)
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Tristitia</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorrow_(emotion)">sorrow</a>/
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)">despair</a>/despondency)
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Ira</em> (wrath)
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Vanagloria</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vainglory">vainglory</a>)
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Acedia</em> (sloth)
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          These "evil thoughts" can be categorized into three types:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            lustful appetite (gluttony, fornication, and avarice)
          </li>
          <li>
            irascibility (wrath)
          </li>
          <li>
            mind corruption (vainglory, sorrow, pride, and discouragement)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In AD 590 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_I">Pope Gregory</a> I revised this list to form the more
          common list. Gregory combined <em>tristitia</em> with <em>acedia</em>, and <em>vanagloria</em> with <em>superbia</em>,
          and added envy, in Latin, <em>invidia</em>. Gregory's list became the standard list of sins.
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a> uses and defends Gregory's list in his
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summa_Theologica"><em>Summa Theologica</em></a> although he calls them the
          "capital sins" because they are the head and form of all the others. The
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican_Communion">Anglican Communion</a>,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheran_Church">Lutheran Church</a>, and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodist_Church">Methodist Church</a>, among other Christian denominations,
          continue to retain this list. Moreover, modern day evangelists, such as
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Graham">Billy Graham</a> have explicated the seven deadly sins.

        <p>
          Most of the capital sins, with the sole exception of sloth, are defined by <a href="">Dante Alighieri</a> as perverse or corrupt versions
          of love for something or another: lust, gluttony, and greed are all excessive or disordered love of good things; sloth is a deficiency of
          love; wrath, envy, and pride are perverted love directed toward other's harm. In the seven capital sins are seven ways of eternal death.
          The capital sins from lust to envy are generally associated with pride, which has been labeled as the father of all sins, etc.
