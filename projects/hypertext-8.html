      <p>
        I have also learned a lot from the access I have through social media and the <a class="link" href="hypertext-3.html">internet</a> in general. For instance, if you have a stuffy nose, you can just google remedies or see what medication to
        take that might help alleviate that symptom. Another thing that I really like about social media is the <a class="link" href="hypertext-9.html">affirmation</a> that you get when you find out that something you do that you thought was <a class="link" href="hypertext-2.html">abnormal</a>
        is actually pretty common behavior.
