      <p>
        Another aspect that is culturally changing due to technology, is how connected the <a class="link" href="hypertext-6.html">world</a> is now. For instance, if there was a huge natural <a class="link" href="hypertext-9.html">disaster</a> in,
        say Japan, the whole world would know about it in an almost real-time status and be able to help <a class="link" href="hypertext-6.html">support</a> the people who are in trouble.
