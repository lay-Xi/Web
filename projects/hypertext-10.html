        However, if you spend most of your <a class="link" href="hypertext-7.html">time</a> consuming online content on YouTube, Instagram, or Snapchat, while it may not be “<a class="link" href="hypertext-6.html">bad</a>” by any means, if you had
        intentions that were cast aside to <a class="link" href="hypertext-8.html">consume</a> said content, I would say it is detrimental.
