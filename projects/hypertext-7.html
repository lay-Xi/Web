      <p>
        For me, personally, I feel like it has made my <a class="link" href="hypertext-1.html">life</a> easier. From being able to check where a place is without consulting a physical map or getting directions from another person, to checking in with
        my family <a class="link" href="hypertext-4.html">overseas</a>, to being able to close the lights in my room without having to flip a switch. These all contribute to tasks that have been <a class="link" href="hypertext-3.html">simplified</a>
        to achieve a goal in the least amount of effort possible.
