        I think having a screen-medicated life has its pros and <a class="link" href="hypertext-10.html">cons</a>. For instance, the “screen” creates <a class="link" href="hypertext-2.html">opportunities</a> for you that would usually not be
        available to you. This gives you options to lead a life away from a screen. Having these <a class="link" href="hypertext-1.html">options</a> make it easier to lead a life outside your screen.
